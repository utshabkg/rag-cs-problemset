FLAG bytes. In this case, there will be 100% overhead.","What is the maximum overhead in byte-stuffing algorithm? [closed]
I have to implement the byte-stuffing algorithm for my assignment, and I have to find the maximum overhead in byte-stuffing. I know that the maximum overhead is the number of bytes added to the original message. But I'm not sure how to calculate it.

If you have to find the maximum overhead in byte-stuffing, then you must be given a specific message to stuff. If not, then there is no maximum overhead. If you are given a message, then the maximum overhead is the length of the message after stuffing divided by the length of the original message.",1.0
